AIM :- To study and implement operators in cpp <br>
Software: Visual Studio Code

Theory :-
Operators are symbols in C++ that manipulate variables and values. Boolean expressions are evaluated by logical operators ({&&}, {||}, {!}) which return true or false. In addition to producing boolean results, relational operators ({=={, {!=}, {{, {>}, {=}, {>=}) compare two values. Basic mathematical operations are carried out using arithmetic operators ({+}, {-}, {*}, {/}, {%}). For conditional statements to maintain control flow, logical operators are essential. In decision-making structures, comparison of values requires the use of relational operators. The foundation of computations are arithmetic operators. Combining these operators allows for the creation of sophisticated expressions and control structures, which makes C++ an effective language for a wide range of programming jobs, from simple arithmetic computations to complex logical comparisons and conditions.

Code :-
```
#include #include // For pow function using namespace std;

int main() { int a = 10, b = 5; bool x = true, y = false; int p = 15, q = 20;

// Arithmetic Operators
cout << "Arithmetic Operators:\n";
cout << "Addition: " << a + b << "\n";
cout << "Subtraction: " << a - b << "\n";
cout << "Multiplication: " << a * b << "\n";
cout << "Division: " << a / b << "\n";
cout << "Modulus: " << a % b << "\n";
cout << "Exponentiation: " << pow(a, b) << "\n";
cout << "Floor Division: " << a / b << "\n\n";

// Logical Operators
cout << "Logical Operators:\n";
cout << (x && y) << "\n";
cout << (x || y) << "\n";
cout << (!x) << "\n";
cout << (!y) << "\n\n";

// Relational Operators
cout << "Relational Operators:\n";
cout << (p == q) << "\n";
cout << (p != q) << "\n";
cout << (p > q) << "\n";
cout << (p < q) << "\n";
cout << (p >= q) << "\n";
cout << (p <= q) << "\n";

return 0;
}
```

Output:-
1[exp3](https://github.com/shrey-raj24/CDS-Experiment-3/blob/main/third.png)

Conclusion :- in this experiment we learnt to use the basic operators like arithematic, functional and logical.
